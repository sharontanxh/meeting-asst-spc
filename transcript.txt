Lidia, the Wifi was spotty over the past few days. I think it's super important for the hackathon that we're planning, and I'm pretty sure we've run into this kind of issue before... Can we get it fixed in time for the hackathon? 

I'm so sorry, there's been so much on my plate. Hey Alex, could you help remind me to do this next week?
